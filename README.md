This memory card game displays a number of images to the user and prompts them to choose one. The game is over when the user selects an image they've already chosen.

This is [a project from The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card,
focussing on React and handling state.
